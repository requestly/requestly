Title: Getting started with Requestly Local Workspace — a hands-on guide

Post:

I published a short guide on using Requestly's Local Workspace to manage API requests and collections locally. It walks through creating a local workspace, adding requests, saving collections, and using pre/post scripts.

Read here: <link>

Key takeaways:
- Safe local experimentation without affecting team workspaces
- Use workspace-scoped variables to store tokens locally
- Export collections when you want to share work

## Extra platforms

- Reddit (r/webdev or r/programming): short title + summary + link

Tips:
- Attach a screenshot of the workspace or a GIF of running a request to increase engagement.
- Post at a time your audience is active (weekday mornings usually work well).
