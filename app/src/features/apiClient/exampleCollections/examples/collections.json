It covers common patterns for querying, mutating, and combining multiple queries within a single request.\n\nThe collection includes:\n\n1. **Get User Details (Query)** \nFetches information about a user by ID, including basic profile data, posts, and address details.\n    \n2. **Create New User (Mutation)** \nDemonstrates how to send variables into a GraphQL mutation to create a new user with nested address and company fields.\n    \n3. **Get User Posts / Albums (Multiple Queries)** \nShows how to execute multiple queries in one request, retrieving both posts and albums of a user simultaneously.\n    \n\nUse this collection as a starting point to learn and test how GraphQL queries, mutations, and combined queries work in real-world APIs.",

      "description": "Documentation is here: [https://github.com/HackerNews/API](https://github.com/HackerNews/API)\n\n## Overview\n\nIn partnership with [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/), we're making the public Hacker News data available in near real time. Firebase enables easy access from [Android](https://firebase.google.com/docs/android/setup), [iOS](https://firebase.google.com/docs/ios/setup) and the [web](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup). [Servers](https://firebase.google.com/docs/server/setup) aren't left out.\n\nIf you can use one of the many [Firebase client libraries](https://firebase.google.com/docs/libraries/), you really should. The libraries handle networking efficiently and can raise events when things change. Be sure to check them out.\n\nPlease email api@ycombinator.com if you find any bugs.\n\n## URI and Versioning\n\nWe hope to improve the API over time. The changes won't always be backward compatible, so we're going to use versioning. This first iteration will have URIs prefixed with `https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/` and is structured as described below. There is currently no rate limit.\n\nFor versioning purposes, only removal of a non-optional field or alteration of an existing field will be considered incompatible changes. *Clients should gracefully handle additional fields they don't expect, and simply ignore them.*\n\n## Design\n\nThe v0 API is essentially a dump of our in-memory data structures. We know, what works great locally in memory isn't so hot over the network. Many of the awkward things are just the way HN works internally. Want to know the total number of comments on an article? Traverse the tree and count. Want to know the children of an item? Load the item and get their IDs, then load them. The newest page? Starts at item maxid and walks backward, keeping only the top level stories. Same for Ask, Show, etc.\n\nI'm not saying this to defend it - It's not the ideal public API, but it's the one we could release in the time we had. While awkward, it's possible to implement most of HN using it.\n\n## Items\n\nStories, comments, jobs, Ask HNs and even polls are just items. They're identified by their ids, which are unique integers, and live under `/v0/item/<id>`.\n\nAll items have some of the following properties, with required properties in bold:\n\nField | Description\n------|------------\n**id** | The item's unique id.\ndeleted | `true` if the item is deleted.\ntype | The type of item. One of \"job\", \"story\", \"comment\", \"poll\", or \"pollopt\".\nby | The username of the item's author.\ntime | Creation date of the item, in [Unix Time](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time).\ntext | The comment, story or poll text. HTML.\ndead | `true` if the item is dead.\nparent | The comment's parent: either another comment or the relevant story.\npoll | The pollopt's associated poll.\nkids | The ids of the item's comments, in ranked display order.\nurl | The URL of the story.\nscore | The story's score, or the votes for a pollopt.\ntitle | The title of the story, poll or job. HTML.\nparts | A list of related pollopts, in display order.\ndescendants | In the case of stories or polls, the total comment count.\n\nFor example, a story: https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/item/8863.json?print=pretty\n\n```javascript\n{\n  \"by\" : \"dhouston\",\n  \"descendants\" : 71,\n  \"id\" : 8863,\n  \"kids\" : [ 8952, 9224, 8917, 8884, 8887, 8943, 8869, 8958, 9005, 9671, 8940, 9067, 8908, 9055, 8865, 8881, 8872, 8873, 8955, 10403, 8903, 8928, 9125, 8998, 8901, 8902, 8907, 8894, 8878, 8870, 8980, 8934, 8876 ],\n  \"score\" : 111,\n  \"time\" : 1175714200,\n  \"title\" : \"My YC app: Dropbox - Throw away your USB drive\",\n  \"type\" : \"story\",\n  \"url\" : \"http://www.getdropbox.com/u/2/screencast.html\"\n}\n```\n\ncomment: https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/item/2921983.json?print=pretty\n\n```javascript\n{\n  \"by\" : \"norvig\",\n  \"id\" : 2921983,\n  \"kids\" : [ 2922097, 2922429, 2924562, 2922709, 2922573, 2922140, 2922141 ],\n  \"parent\" : 2921506,\n  \"text\" : \"Aw shucks, guys ... you make me blush with your compliments.<p>Tell you what, Ill make a deal: I'll keep writing if you keep reading.

While you can subscribe to individual items and profiles, you'll need to use the following to observe front page ranking, new items, and new profiles.\n\n### Max Item ID\n\nThe current largest item id is at `/v0/maxitem`. You can walk backward from here to discover all items.\n\nExample: https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/maxitem.json?print=pretty\n\n```javascript\n9130260\n```\n\n### New, Top and Best Stories\n\nUp to 500 top and new stories are at `/v0/topstories` (also contains jobs) and `/v0/newstories`. Best stories are at `/v0/beststories`.\n\nExample: https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/topstories.json?print=pretty\n\n```javascript\n[ 9129911, 9129199, 9127761, 9128141, 9128264, 9127792, 9129248, 9127092, 9128367, ..., 9038733 ]\n```\n\n### Ask, Show and Job Stories\n\nUp to 200 of the latest Ask HN, Show HN, and Job stories are at `/v0/askstories`, `/v0/showstories`, and `/v0/jobstories`.\n\nExample: https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/askstories.json?print=pretty\n\n```javascript\n[ 9127232, 9128437, 9130049, 9130144, 9130064, 9130028, 9129409, 9127243, 9128571, ..., 9120990 ]\n```\n\n### Changed Items and Profiles\n\nThe item and profile changes are at `/v0/updates`.\n\nExample: https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/updates.json?print=pretty\n\n```javascript\n{\n  \"items\" : [ 8423305, 8420805, 8423379, 8422504, 8423178, 8423336, 8422717, 8417484, 8423378, 8423238, 8423353, 8422395, 8423072, 8423044, 8423344, 8423374, 8423015, 8422428, 8423377, 8420444, 8423300, 8422633, 8422599, 8422408, 8422928, 8394339, 8421900, 8420902, 8422087 ],\n  \"profiles\" : [ \"thefox\", \"mdda\", \"plinkplonk\", \"GBond\", \"rqebmm\", \"neom\", \"arram\", \"mcmancini\", \"metachris\", \"DubiousPusher\", \"dochtman\", \"kstrauser\", \"biren34\", \"foobarqux\", \"mkehrt\", \"nathanm412\", \"wmblaettler\", \"JoeAnzalone\", \"rcconf\", \"johndbritton\", \"msie\", \"cktsai\", \"27182818284\", \"kevinskii\", \"wildwood\", \"mcherm\", \"naiyt\", \"matthewmcg\", \"joelhaus\", \"tshtf\", \"MrZongle2\", \"Bogdanp\" ]\n}\n```",

It's an isolated space where you can keep common stuff in a common bucket.This gets useful when you want to swap out the bucket whenever you want. \n\n## Collection Variables\nHere you can keep the base data that doesn't rely on environment and will stay the same but is used in multiple places.

These scripts get executed before sending a request and after receiving a response. \n\nNot just that, we can write tests in this script that can make sure `1==1` is indeed true of if the shape of the data is correct or not.\n\nThese scripts also have access to variables and can set or get anything including collection variables.",
