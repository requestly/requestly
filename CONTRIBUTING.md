# Contributing to Requestly

First off, thank you for considering to contribute! Itâ€™s people like you that make Requestly such a great tool. We look forward to improve the lives of web engineers together. 

This documentation will guide you through the process of development and contribution to the Requestly source code.

## Code of conduct

We adhere to the [Requestly code of conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and by participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to contact@requestly.io.

## Reporting issues

We use [Github issues](https://github.com/requestly/requestly/issues) to track feature requests and bugs. Please check existing issues before filing anything new. We do our best to respond to the issues as earliest as possible. 

If you would like to contribute a fix, please let us know by leaving a comment on the issue.

## Pull Requests

Before submitting any pull request (PR), it is recommended that you first log an issue [here](https://github.com/requestly/requestly/issues) and explain your solution in comments if it is more than a typo fix. It is always a good idea to gather feedback from the team to reduce the number of iterations in code review. 

Please note that we have multiple Git repositories. The [Development](#development) section below will help you find the right repo to make changes in. But the issues are still managed centrally in this repository.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. Add a clear description covering your changes.
3. Reference the Github issue in the PR description.
4. Follow and update all items in the PR checklist.

All submissions require code review from team. So, please be patient. In case your PR is in opened state for more than 2 weeks without any response from us, feel free to escalate at contact@requestly.io. 

## Development

Requestly is composed of multiple modules:
- [Browser extension](./browser-extension)
- [UI application](./app)
- [Desktop application](https://github.com/requestly/requestly-desktop-app) (Electron-based application for MacOS, Linux, Windows)
- [Mobile SDK](https://github.com/requestly/requestly-android-sdk) (to debug mobile apps)
- [Web SDK](https://github.com/requestly/requestly-web-sdk) (facilitates Session Recording)
- [Mock Server](https://github.com/requestly/requestly-mock-server)
- [Backend](https://github.com/requestly/requestly-backend)

This repository contains the source code for Browser extension and UI application which make up the core of Requestly.

Please follow the [Getting Started Guide](./getting-started.md) to get to know about the development process in this repository.

## Documentation

We try to keep our documentation always up to date. When making changes to any UI component, please make sure that you also raise a pull request to update the corresponding documentation page to reflect latest changes.

Documentations are managed in a separate repository:
https://github.com/requestly/requestly-docs
