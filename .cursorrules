# Cursor Rules for Requestly Project

## Project Context
This is the Requestly project - a browser extension and web application for request interception and modification.

## Code Organization
- `app/` - Main web application
- `browser-extension/` - Browser extension code
- `shared/` - Shared utilities and components
- `common/` - Common code used across different parts
- `ee/` - Enterprise features
- `public/` - Static assets

## Dead Code Areas
- `dist/` - Build output directory (contains generated files, avoid editing)
- `node_modules/` - Dependencies (never edit directly)
- `browser-extension/sessionbear`

## Coding Guidelines
- Follow existing code style and patterns
- Use TypeScript where applicable
- Maintain backward compatibility for browser extension APIs
- Follow the existing file structure and naming conventions

## Special Instructions
- When working with browser extension code, consider cross-browser compatibility
- Shared utilities should be placed in `shared/` directory
- Enterprise features should be isolated in `ee/` directory
- Always test changes across different browsers for extension code
- Communication between Web app and Browser Extension happens through Message Handling

## Dead Code Warnings
⚠️ The following directories contain generated/dead code:
- `dist/` - Build artifacts, do not edit
- `node_modules/` - Dependencies, do not edit
- Any `.min.js` files are minified and should not be edited directly
