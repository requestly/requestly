Requestly allows you to modify network (HTTP/S) requests by setting up **'Rules'** for **Redirects, Modifying Headers, Switching Hosts, Injecting Custom Scripts, Cancelling & Throttling Requests, Modifying request body and Modifying AJAX responses, to share debugging sessions and a whole lot more!**

Requestly also offers a library service which allows you to upload and host JS/CSS files with direct links to ease debugging process. These files can also be used directly inside rules **with a single click!**

## Documentation üìï

Please visit our [documentation](https://docs.requestly.io/) for step-by-step guide to get started with Requestly. 

## Why Requestly üôã

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35186614/153814415-6c0c5db7-998d-47cb-bedd-696e3ac30708.png)

üë®‚Äçüíª **Easy Interface** - Primarily designed for web developers ‚Äì Requestly enables easy debugging of remote & external scripts using simple Redirect & Script Rules.

üóÉ **Mock Server** - Requestly lets you create a simple server which can be used in Requestly rules. No need to setup local server now.

üí¨ **Regex Support** - Requestly has rich interface to provide url matching conditions. Multiple Operators are supported ‚Äì Equals, Contains, Regex (Matches) and Regex with wildcard too.

üëØ **Auto Sync** - Requestly rules are stored in cloud so even if you change your device, when you login you will get back your rules.

üíª **Multi Browser** - Requestly is available for Chrome, Firefox and Edge. We intend to support Safari & Opera in near future. Debugging cross browser issues is lot more easier.

‚¨á **Backup & Share** - Requestly allows you to download rules as text file. You can also share a list of rules by generating a public url and providing that to other users.

## Features ‚ú®

#### üåê Modify Request URL

Requestly allows you to modify the url of ongoing request and you can change the url to something else. Common examples include:

- Setting up Redirects (eg, facebook.com -> quora.com)
- Creating URL shortcuts (e.g. Type j-1 in address bar will open jira.corp.example.com/projects/jira-1).
- Switching Hosts (All requests for xyz.com should go to abc.com)
- Block websites (e.g. Block social media websites to stay productive)
- Modify some part of URL (be it host, path, query parameters etc)
- Stay way from time killing sites. Setup rules like when source contains facebook.com or twitter.com then redirect to StackOverflow and do some geeky stuff.
- Test your JS running in production environment. Simply redirect your JS from prod to JS from your local setup box and test if your fix/code actually works in production site.

#### üìú Insert Custom Scripts

- Run scripts on website and customize the web pages you want
- Support your script with popular libraries like jQuery and underscore.
- Use FileHosting service to upload long scripts and get a URL to be used in your websites or Requestly rules
- Very similar to GreaseMonkey or TamperMonkey user scripts

#### üßÆ Host JS/CSS Files

Use Library Service to host JS/CSS Files and use the URLs inside Requestly rules. No need to setup local server.

#### üé¨ Modify Headers

Modify HTTP Request & Response headers. (Extremely helpful for web developers for debugging applications)

#### üì± Modify User Agent

- Setup different user agents for websites and test how they behave
- Useful for web developers for testing cross-device compatibility

#### üîå Modify API Request body and Response

- Use Modify API Request body Rule to define custom payload for any intercepted request.
- Use Modify API Response Rule to define custom response to any intercepted request.

#### üé• Share debugging sessions

Share debugging sessions with Video, console logs, network logs, and env details with teammates.
